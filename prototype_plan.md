**prototype plan** for the **Modern-Fantasy Wild Frontier RPG**.
with *RDR2 countryside vibes* + *Ghost of Tsushima scenery* + *Souls-like creature battles* + *Pokémon-style catching/training*.

---

## **1. Prototype Scope (What We’re Making First)**

Goal: A **small but complete gameplay loop** in one rural area with:

* **Exploration**: Walk, parkour, stealth.
* **Creature Encounters**: Souls-like real-time battles.
* **Catching & Training**: Basic system to store creatures.
* **Hub Area**: Small settlement with NPCs.
* **Quests**: 1–2 short story tasks.

---

## **2. World Setting for Prototype**

* **The Hub** – A **small frontier village/outpost**
  * Wooden buildings, barns, windmill.
  * Dirt road leading out to fields and forest.
  * NPCs: Shopkeeper, Quest Giver, Creature Trainer (tutorial).

* **Wild Zone** – The surrounding countryside
  * Tall grass fields for stealth and hiding.
  * Cliffs and rocky outcrops for climbing.
  * Small river or pond for visual variety.
  * A few wild creatures roaming around.

---

## **3. Core Gameplay Loop**

1. **Explore** the hub and countryside.
2. **Spot a creature** → sneak up or approach.
3. If close enough, **trigger battle mode**:
   * Camera shifts, player now controls their creature.
   * Souls-like real-time combat (dodge, light attack, heavy attack, special move).
4. **Win the battle**:
   * Option to “catch” if creature’s health is low.
   * Caught creatures stored in inventory.
5. Return to hub to **heal, train, and upgrade**.
6. Repeat with harder creatures.
